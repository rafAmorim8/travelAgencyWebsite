			<h3>Thailand Intinerary: Summary</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>Two weeks is a short time to explore Thailand to the fullest. However this itinerary is crafted to give you a good grasp of the entire country while keeping the logistics as easy as possible.<br><br>After arriving at the capital Bangkok, the idea is to know a bit of the lush (and more authentic) north of the country. An escape to the world-famous Thai islands on the south is inevitable and it is the best place to relax before ending your trip. Here is a quick summary of this travel itinerary for Thailand in 2 weeks:<br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Bangkok:</b> 3 days</li>
					<li><b>Chiang Mai:</b> 3 days</li>
					<li><b>Krabi/Railay:</b> 5 days</li>
					<li><b>Koh Lanta:</b> 3 days</li>
					<li><b>Bangkok:</b> 1 days</li>
				</ul>

						<h4>Bangkok - Days 1 to 3:</h4>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Onb9rd2.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Picture of the streets of Bangkok">
						
						<p>Most international flights land in Bangkok and it is normally the first stop of travelers arriving in Thailand. Bangkok is one of those places full of history and culture. </p>
						<h5>What to Do?</h5>
						<p>Don’t miss out the temples area – Wat Pho, Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Arun – are amazing pieces of architecture. A golden option to dive in Thai culture right from the beginning.<br><br> We recommend you to take the first day to rest and recover your energies. So, stay at the hotel, enjoy its structure: the pool and game room are great options. It will be important to be relaxed for the rest of the trip as lots of walking and swimming are waiting for you.<br><br> On the second day go to the temples: Wat Pho and Wat Phra Kaew. They are such amazing places that tell a little about their religion and culture.<br><br>Bangkok is also an awesome place for shopping, however it is important to save all the shopping for when you’re back to Bangkok on the end of the trip. There’s no point in carrying extra stuff throughout your trip, right?.</p>

						<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
						<p>It makes sense to stay near to one of the shopping areas in Bangkok. But since you’ll come back to the capital in the end of the trip, this is not a priority for now. So we selected the iSanook Hotel, it has a great swimming pool and breakfast in a very quiet area. They offer FREE taxi service to the main areas of the city. The room is super clean, they have friendly staff and an amazing breakfast in a terrace with a gorgeous views over Bangkok.</p>

					<div class="chiangMaiBox clearfix">
						<h4>Chiang May - Days 4 to 6:</h4>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9FDk1T9.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Chiang Mai Temple's picture">
						<p>This is usually the favorite place for our clients in Thailand. The stunning scenery, the cheap massage places, the monks on the streets and specially the overall vibe of the place is awesome. No wonder Chiang Mai has become a paradise for expats. Between the coffeeshops filled with digital nomads and hipster vegetarian restaurants, there is just enough to weirdly make you feel home away from home.</p>
						<h5>What to Do?</h5>
						<p>Chiang Mai is a paradise for adventure seekers. There are a lot of unique experiences you can do there. The shuttle bus is going to pick you up and take you to your daily activities for the entire day, which are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Day 4: Trekking on the mountains</li>
							<li>Day 5: Cooking Classes</li>
							<li>Day 6: Elephant sanctuaries</li>
						</ul>

						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oc5XQwY.jpg" class="rounded float-left imgHotel" alt="Hotel Rich Lanna picture">
						<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
						<p>It is important to stay inside the Old Town walls to be in walking distance of all the major sights. That is why we have selected the Rich Lanna House Hotel.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="krabiBox clearfix">
						<h4>Krabi/Railay Beach - Days 7 to 11:</h4>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VuwlpZp.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Krabi Picture">
						<p>Time to fly to the islands!</p>
						<h5>What to Do?</h5>
						<p>As people say, Railay Beach is a beach you must visit at least once in your life. It is a gem and the scenery of limestone cliffs around is indeed stunning. You can also go to Phra Nhang, a 15-min walk through the peninsula or “just around the corner” by kayak. <br><br>Krabi is a worldwide renowned spot for rock-climbing, and it is always enjoyable to explore the nearby islands. Longtails (a small private boat) will take you to nearby inhabited paradises. <br><br> Also a bigger boat is going to take you to Thailand’s major hotpot: Phi Phi islands, where you are going to stay most of your time.</p>
						<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FHTp8kf.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="The Railay Resort Spa">
						<p>Railay, a small peninsula with many resorts and hotels. Very touristy, and full of beatiful beaches in walking distance. Curious monkeys are known to visit hotel’s balconies as well.<br><br>The resort is in a quiet location, has 2 amazing swimming pools and a memorable breakfast.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="kohLantaBox clearfix">
						<h4>Koh Lanta - Days 12 to 14:</h4>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gse5nvT.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="KohLanta Picture">
						<p>With a wild jungle scenery in the interior, a huge Marine National Park and long sandy beaches, Koh Lanta is a great final stop to any Thai trip. TTe island can be reached by ferry/bus, which is already included. And it is also a great place to go back to Bangkok, your final destination.</p>
						<h5>What to Do?</h5>
						<p>After 11 exaustive days, all you will want to do is stay at the hotel's pool and enjoy the delicious food and taste their exotic drinks.</p>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xEGnZ64.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Long Beach Chalet Picture">
						<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
						<p>The hotels along Long Beach are a great place to stay. With memorable sunset shows every day, you are in for a treat! They also offer sun beds and breakfast on the beach. The Long Beach Chalet is a high-quality and comfortable Thai-style bungalow just 5-min walk from the best beach in Koh Lanta.</p>
