# Travel Agency Website
Website created as a project for the Web Development I course at Langara.

The assignment required a fully functional website with at least 5 pages. I opted to use Bootstrap as a firts practical experience using it as a tool to help make the website responsive.

If you want to see the website running, plese visit my CodePen profile at: https://codepen.io/RafAmorim/ or go to the project directly at: https://codepen.io/RafAmorim/pen/xvXaYV.
