			<h3>Australia Intinerary: Summary</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>Three weeks is not enough time to explore Australia to the fullest. So you need to focus on the main cities and attractions. This itinerary is intended to give you a good grasp of the entire country while keeping the logistics as easy as possible.<br><br>You will visit the following countries:<br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Sydney:</b> 7 days</li>
					<li><b>Gold Coast:</b> 5 days</li>
					<li><b>Cairns:</b> 3 days</li>
					<li><b>Melbourne:</b> 4 days</li>

					<h4>Sydney - Days 1 to 7:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/86CBG6O.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Sydney's Bondi Beach Pool picture">
					<p>When you visit Australia you can’t miss Sydney. Besides being Australia’s largest city, there are many reasons why Sydney is also the most visited.<br>The stunning harbour side location, the iconic beaches, excellent restaurants, fantastic cafes and pubs, world heritage sites, terrific shopping, incredible festivals, a multicultural population, and good year round weather.<br>So don’t just use Sydney as a gateway to Australia, with so much to see and experience give yourself seven days. Trust me, Sydney won’t let you down.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><b>Walk around Circular Quay –</b> The best place to start your visit is in Circular Quay, the main transport hub of Sydney Harbour and where two of Australia’s most famous landmarks reside;<br><b>Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge -</b> Consider taking a 1 hour tour of the Opera House. Otherwise, just wander around and take your “I was here” photo.<br><b>Royal Botanic Gardens –</b>you can’t beat the serenity and harbour views from these gardens. Have a picnic or take a walk and admire the many different types of plants and city views on a free self-guided walking tour.<br><b>Explore The Rocks District – </b>The Rocks District is a historic area of Sydney and my favourite part of the CBD. It’s home to Sydney’s oldest pubs, cobblestone streets, weekend markets, and views of the harbour.<br><b>Climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge –</b> climbing one of the most famous bridges in the world is a once in a lifetime experience. Take either a dawn, day, twilight, or night climb and take in the breathtaking views. Visit BridgeClimb.com (book well in advance).<br><b>Walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge –</b> a cheaper option than climbing is to simply walk across for FREE and take in the same views on a lower level. Or visit the Pylon Lookout for $11 and get fantastic views plus 3 levels of exhibits to learn about the history of the Bridge.<br><b>Bondi Beach to Coogee Coastal Walk  –</b> one of my favourite free things to do in Sydney. A stunning coastal walk and the perfect way to spend a gorgeous few hours in Sydney.</p>

					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Maroubra Beach Hotel which is located in one of the most beautiful beaches of Sydey. Maroubra is not as crowded as the other beaches in Sydney and offers a great amount of restaurants and local shops.</p>

					<h4>Gold Coast - Days 8 to 12:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hqwxN5B.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Gold Coast">
					<p>For generations, the Gold Coast has been Australia’s capital of fun, embracing and entertaining travelers with a spectacle of golden beaches, legendary theme parks, iconic rain-forests and lively attractions. Though with opportunities for adventure on land, air, and sea, the most difficult question is actually how to fit it all in! Best things to do on the Gold Coast.<br>To help you out, the following is a 4 day Gold Coast itinerary suited to the luxury adventurer; a terrific combination of adrenalin pumping thrills set on one of Australia’s most spectacular natural stages.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><b>Jet boating</b> is similar to that of a theme park rollercoaster ride, though on the water. And you should expect to get soaked! Experience full 360° spins, high speed drifting, incredible beach buzzing and other exciting manoeuvres in as little as 10cms of water…while you explore the Gold Coast’s unique waterways.<br><b>Have lunch at the pier –</b> there are many waterfront restaurants and cafes to choose from. It’s then time to start the drive to your accommodation.<br><b>Rainforest Glamping</b>Glamping on the Gold Coast is a fantastic way to step back from the excess’ and complications of modern life. And immersing yourself in nature and sleeping under the stars no longer means having to sacrifice on comfort.<br>Book for two nights at Nightfall Wilderness Camp; this is a glamping site in a relatively untouched pocket of paradise, perched delicately beside the crystal-clear tumbling headwaters of Christmas Creek and Queensland’s ancient Lamington National Park rainforests.<br><b>Hinterland Trail Ride</b> with Gold Coast Equestrian Centre in the morning. There are many World Heritage Listed rainforest trails throughout the hinterland for bushwalking, though it’s a little more unique to explore by horse.</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8gofuhs.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel GC picture">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>The GC Hotel is the best place to stay in Gold Coast. It was built right in the heart of the Surfers Paradise beach.</p>

					<h4>Cairns - Days 13 to 15:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dotCW9w.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Philippines Beach and Mountains picture">
					<p>As one of Australia’s biggest tourist towns and gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is vibrant with plenty of restaurants and cafes to keep you happy. The weather is typically amazing, you can walk around at night and have plenty to do, and the days are filled with an enormous amount of choice to explore the surrounding regions. Whilst Cairns is mostly about getting out on the Great Barrier Reef, the surrounding hinterlands and nearby rainforest are definitely worth exploring.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><b>Swim at the Cairns lagoon – </b>the cruelty of the north is you get hot summers but you can’t swim in the beaches, they’re full of stingers (jelly fish that can seriously harm you, even kill you). There’s also a few crocs around too. The main beach in Cairns is also more of a mud flat. Not to fear, the man-made Cairns lagoon gives you exactly what you need. Crystal clear waters, beach views and life guards. It’s a cool place to laze around and read your book.<br><b>Day trip to the Great Barrier Reef -</b>a true wonder of the world that is 2,300km long and consists of 900 islands and 2,900 individual reefs. It’s the world’s largest coral reef and the largest living structure on the planet. There are many options for getting out on the reef, some of the main operators are Reef Magic Cruises, Quicksilver Cruises, and Reef Experience. And this post explains how we experienced the reef!<br><b>Green Island -</b> a coral cay surrounded by white sandy beaches and magnificent coral reefs. You can snorkel straight off the shore and there’s a nice boardwalk through the forest to the other side of the island.<br><b>Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park –</b> Tapajukai Aboriginal Cultural Park is loved for its simplicity and the down to earth way the local people share their culture. You can watch dancing shows, and get up on stage and dance and sing with them, learn abbot the didgeridoo, bush medicine and food, and have a chance to throw boomerangs and spears.</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DIINlVw.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Cairns Press">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Cairns Press for your stay in Cairns. It is a 5 star hotel that fits the taste of every traveller.</p>

					<h4>Melbourne/Great Ocean Road- Days 16 to 21:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zBFju8P.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Melbourne Twelve-Apostles Picture">
					<p>There really is something for everyone in Melbourne, no matter what your budget or tastes are. Also, it is a well known fact among Australians that they make the best coffee in the country!<br>Pick up your rental car from the airport and hit the Great Ocean Road, famous in Australia and around the world as one of the best drives on the planet. Beginning one hour outside of Melbourne in the town of Torquay, it stretches over 250 kilometres to Warrnambool, and attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year. Whilst the tour buses crazily drive this in one day, don’t just rush to the 12 Apostles for your tourist snap. Slow down and appreciate all it has to offer.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><b>Otways National Park – </b>head into the Otways and immerse yourself among tall trees and giant tree ferns, and beautiful waterfalls – Triplet Falls is a highlight. The walk is about a 1 hour return loop. And the 2km Shelley Beach Circuit Walk is one of the best short walks on the Great Ocean Walk.<br><b>Kennett River – </b>want to see koalas in the wild? The best koala viewing spot is Kennet River, along the Grey River Road, just in the middle of town. Otway Lighthouse Road is another popular spot. Just look for the crowds of people and follow their gazes up for quick koala spotting.<br><b>Twelve Apostles (87 kms from Apollo Bay) – </b>Port Campbell National Park is home to these massive limestone structures tower 45 metres above the ocean and were formed some 20 million years ago. There are only eight remaining (the rest have fallen) and forming the backdrop are these magnificent cliffs up to 70 metres high. Hot Tip – get there for sunrise or sunset so you miss the hordes of people and tour buses that arrive around lunchtime (we stayed overnight in Port Campbell, 15 km drive and drove back for sunset).<br><b>City Circle Tram – </b>jump on the FREE city circle tram service (route 35) that operates within Melbourne’s CBD and passes major tourist attractions. The loop takes about 45 minutes and you can get off at any one of the many stops to explore more on foot, and is the best way to get around to many of Melbourne’s inner city highlights.<br><b>Federation Square – </b>Fed Square occupies a whole urban block right on the banks of the Yarra River and directly opposite Flinders Street Train Station and St Paul’s Cathedral in the heart of the city. There’s museums, galleries, restaurants, bars, festivals and fun. And the Melbourne Visitor Centre is located underground. Such a cool urban square!</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IMiNY8N.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Ocean Road">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We selected the Ocean Road Hotel because it is convenientlt located at the beggining of the Great Ocean Road. A rental car will be booked for you so you can go to the CBD as well as to a road trip to see the 12 Apostles.</p>
