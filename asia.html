					<h4>Vietnam - Days 1 to 6:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HIRMrSk.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Vietnam Picture">
					<p>Bustling cities and incredible natural beauty make Vietnam an incredible country to visit, even if you can only stay for a week. In seven days, you’ll be able to see Vietnam’s highlights, making your way from Ho Chi Minh City in the south to Ha Long Bay in the far north.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><em>Day 1:</em> Hanoi <br> Fly into Hanoi and visit sites such as the Old Quarter, Ho Chi Minh’s Mausoleum, the Presidential Palace, the One Pillar Pagoda, the Temple of Literature, and the Ethnology Museum. Take an overnight train to Sapa. <br><br><em>Day 2-3:</em> Sapa <br>Arrive in Sapa and spend the day hiking through the Hoang Lien mountain range and rice paddies. Meet local Vietnamese tribes in their villages and consider staying with a local family rather than at a hotel. Spend your second day in Sapa hiking through bamboo forests and visiting Giang Ta Chai waterfall, the Muong Hoa River, and the villages of Giang Ta Chai and Supan. Take an overnight train back to Hanoi at the end of Day 3.<br><br><em>Day 4:</em>Ha Long Bay <br>After returning to Hanoi, be picked up for your tour of Ha Long Bay. Spend the next night on the ship and explore the thousands of islets, caves, and rock formations. Enjoy water activities such as swimming, kayaking, or visiting a pearl farm.<br><br><em>Day 5-6:</em> Cat Ba Island <br>Explore Cat Ba National Park and choose between relaxing on the beach or hiking to the top of the mountain for a stunning view of the entire bay. Spend the night on the island before returning to Hanoi for your last day.<br><br><em>Day 7:</em> Hanoi <br>Spend the morning picking up some souvenirs in the Old Quarter and depart for your next destination: Cambodia.</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VcsJVdc.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Lusbela's Room picture">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Lusbela Hotels for your stay in Vietnam as they have branches across the country, specifically in the cities that you will be staying. Breakfast and bus shuttle is included.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="cambodiaBox clearfix">
					<h4>Cambodia - Days 7 to 12:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YcrpZrn.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Cambodian Monk's picture">
					<p>Southeast Asia has been firmly on the “backpacker trail” for years, thanks to its great food, diverse cultures, and budget-friendly prices. And while Thailand is usually the first country travelers think of when they consider visiting this stunning part of the world, neighboring Cambodia has grown in popularity in recent years. Visit, and you’ll see why.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><em>Day 7:</em> Phnom Penh <br> Start your Cambodia adventure in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Located at the confluence of the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, Phnom Penh was once called the “Pearl of Asia” because of its French influences and overall popularity. Today, Phnom Penh is still the heart of Cambodia economically, politically, and culturally.<br><br><em>Day 8-11:</em> Siem Reap <br>Spend today traveling from Phnom Penh (the real capital of Cambodia) to Siem Reap (the tourist capital of Cambodia). If given the opportunity, stop on the way in the market village of Skuon or “Spiderville,” where the locals are known for farming large spiders and serving them up deep-fried. (This stop is included on the tour I joined, and our guide came back on the bus with a whole bag of deep-fried bugs!)<br><br><em>Day 12 and :</em> Battambang <br>Even though you could easily spend an entire week just exploring the Angkor temples, it’s worth seeing another part of Cambodia. So, head to Battambang, Cambodia’s second most populous city. It lacks the traffic of Phnom Penh and the visitor numbers of Siem Reap, meaning it’s a great place to get a real slice of the country’s culture.</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tmpHuMV.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Djulino's picture">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Djulino Resorts for your stay in Cambodia as they have branches across the country, specifically in the cities that you will be staying. This is one of the most famous resorts of the country, where most of the Holywood celebrities stay.</p>

				<div class="philippinesBox clearfix">
					<h4>Philippines - Days 13 to 15:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3kniBgV.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Philippine's nature picture">
					<p>Metropolitan Manila, located in the middle of the 7,107 (and counting) islands of the Philippines, is the country’s capital; home to business districts, an interesting mix of local culture, and incredibly warm people.<br>Manila (with its warmth) is still very much welcoming. More than just a jumping point to historical sites in Luzon and the famous islands in Visayas, Manila is a destination in itself especially with the good mix of historical cities and modern towns. There are many ways to spend 3 days in the capital, but here’s a sample mix of old and modern Manila.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><em>Day 13:</em> Get a Hold of Old Manila <br> The capital isn’t considered the capital for no reason – it is incredibly rich in history, dating all the way back in the 1500s, and the country has preserved key locations to remind the Filipinos (and the world) about the past. One of which is Intramuros.<br><br><em>Day 14:</em> Park Museums and an Enterteinment Complex <br>After seeing and knowing about Jose Rizal, it is a must to visit Rizal Park – a historical park where the national hero was executed, which brought about the revolution against Spain in 1896. Visit in the morning so it’s less busy.<br><br><em>Day 15</em> Shop and Experience Manila's Night Life <br>Greenhills Shopping Center is your friendliest option in terms of shopping convenience and accessibility. It is an air-conditioned & bargain-friendly all-day market that sells everything from clothes to souvenirs, as well as mobile phones and accessories. The market area only accepts cash, however (but you can haggle!).</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EJWQGIv.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Travellence Front Door">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Travellence Hotel for your stay in Manila. It is located in the heart of Manila, which is a perfect feet for this 3 days you will be spending there.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="thailandBox clearfix">
					<h4>Thailand - Days 16 to 28:</h4>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ky2boiJ.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Phi phi island picture">
					<p>Thailand has hundreds of great beaches, ranging from large tourist resorts to remote beaches largely undiscovered by tourists. Thailand’s long coastline and wide range of destinations make it arguably Asia’s best destination for lovers of sand, sea and sun.</p>
					<h5>What to Do?</h5>
					<p><em>Day 16-19:</em> Chiang Mai <br> Chiang Mai is a paradise for adventure seekers. There are a lot of unique experiences you can do there. The shuttle bus is going to pick you up and take you to your daily activities for the entire day, which are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Day 16: Trekking on the mountains</li>
							<li>Day 17: Cooking Classes</li>
							<li>Day 18: Elephant sanctuaries</li>
						</ul><br><br><em>Day 20-21:</em> Krabi/Railay Beach<br>Krabi is a worldwide renowned spot for rock-climbing, and it is always enjoyable to explore the nearby islands. Longtails (a small private boat) will take you to nearby inhabited paradises. <br><br> Also a bigger boat is going to take you to Thailand’s major hotpot: Phi Phi islands, where you are going to stay most of your time.<br><br><em>Day 22-28</em> Phi Phi Island<br> Koh Phi Phi is located roughly halfway between Phuket and Krabi. You can get to the island by ferry and speed boat from either destination, making Koh Phi Phi a great two-night destination for travellers spending most of their holidays in Phuket, Krabi or other nearby areas.</p>
					
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cEbsFJu.jpg" class="float-left rounded imgHotel" alt="Hotel Saint Elephant outside area picture">
					<h5>Where to Stay?</h5>
					<p>We chose the Saint Elephant Resort for your stay in Phi Phi. This resort has outstanding views and customer service. As a little treat all drinks and food are on us - so enjoy the end of your trip!</p>
